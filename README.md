# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Ultra-Marathon Running Dataset

Objective

The objective of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large dataset of ultra-marathon running records spanning from 1798 to 2022. The project aims to gain insights into the world of ultra-marathon running, including trends, patterns, and characteristics of ultra-marathon races and participants.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of over 7 million race records from ultra-marathon events registered between 1798 and 2022. The dataset includes information such as race dates, event names, distances, number of finishers, athlete performances, athlete demographics, and more.

Key Steps:

Data Loading: Load the ultra-marathon running dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Explore the distribution of variables such as race distances, athlete ages, and athlete performances using summary statistics, histograms, and box plots.
Analyze the relationships between variables, such as the correlation between race distances and athlete performances.
Identify trends and patterns in the data over time, including the growth of ultra-marathon events and changes in athlete demographics.
Visualization: Create visualizations using Seaborn to better understand the data and communicate key insights effectively. Visualizations may include histograms of race distances, bar plots of athlete age distributions, scatter plots of race performance versus age, and heatmaps of race densities over time.
Insights and Conclusion: Summarize the key findings from the EDA process, including insights into the characteristics of ultra-marathon races and participants. Draw conclusions based on the analysis conducted, such as trends in race participation, performance improvements over time, and demographic shifts in the ultra-marathon community.
Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, analysis, and visualizations.
Documentation explaining the steps followed in the analysis, key findings, and insights derived from the ultra-marathon running dataset.
Python Libraries Used:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Matplotlib: For creating additional visualizations if needed.
Expected Outcome:
The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of ultra-marathon running data, shedding light on the evolution of ultra-marathon events and the characteristics of participants. The EDA process will uncover insights that can inform event organizers, athletes, and researchers in the field of ultra-marathon running, contributing to a better understanding of this unique and challenging sport.
